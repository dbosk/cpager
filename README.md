cpager
======

This is my original page-replacement simulator written in C.  I use(d) it on 
a course on the fundamentals of operating systems, you'll find the course 
[here](https://github.com/dbosk/opsys/).  I later rewrote it in Python, since 
my students were more familiar with Python rather than C.  You'll find the 
Python version [here](https://github.com/dbosk/pypager/).  Personally I prefer 
the C version, and if you've ever taken a course on operating systems you know 
why.
